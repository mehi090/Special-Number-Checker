Special Number Checker (Prime & Palindromic)This Python application identifies "Special Numbers" within a user-defined range. A number is considered special if it satisfies two conditions: it must be a prime number and it must be palindromic (reads the same forward and backward).Project OverviewThe script provides an algorithmic approach to number theory by filtering integers based on primality and symmetry. It is designed to handle user inputs for a specific range $[m, n]$ and efficiently return all numbers that meet the "special" criteria.FeaturesPrime Detection: Implements an optimized primality test by checking factors up to the square root of the number.Palindrome Validation: Checks if a number's string representation is identical to its reverse.Range Filtering: Processes a collection of numbers between a minimum ($m$) and maximum ($n$) value provided by the user.Performance Tracking: Utilizes the timeit module to measure the execution time of the search process.How It WorksInput: The user enters a starting small number ($m$) and a target large number ($n$).Logic:The is_prime function filters out non-prime numbers.The is_a_palindromic function checks for symmetry.The is__a_special_number function combines both logic gates.Output: The program prints a list of all identified special numbers and the total time taken for the calculation.Technical StackLanguage: Python 3.xModules: timeit (for performance benchmarking)UsageRun the script using a Python interpreter:Bashpython "Algorithm final.py"
Example Input:PlaintextEnter small number (m): 10
Enter large number (n): 200
Example Output:PlaintextSpecial number between 10 and 200 :
[11, 101, 131, 151, 181, 191]
